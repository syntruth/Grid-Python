* Already rewrote Grid.copy() to prevent old Cell instance references in
  the returned new Grid instance.
* Added clear_all(), populate(), number_of_cells() and copy() methods to
  the Grid glass.
* Moved neighbors() and traverse() from Point class to Grid class, where
  they belonged in the first place.
* Updated Grid.is_sane() to use more python-esque check for x/y values.
* Updated Point class vector constants values, since they were "backwards"
  with 1,1 actually being in the top left of the grid.
